        			What is Premier Langage (PL) ?
        		</h2>
        		<p>
        			PL is a platform of exercises for multiple subjects (Mathematics, computer sciences, ...) with auto-correction. 
        			It is easy to use for both students and teachers.<br>
        			We want to allow teachers to create exercises easily by providing them templates for MCQ, drag and drop, cloze test, etc... <br>
        			We are also providing an easy-to-use language based on Python to create advanced exercises. Teachers will be able to create exercises in python and javascript without loosing integration to the platform. <br>
